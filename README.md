# Bright.HMU

Bright.HMU is an interactive, AI‑enhanced learning platform for students of the Hellenic Mediterranean University. It is one of the first experimental attempts to combine structured lessons, quizzes, and an integrated large language model (LLM) to support university‑level learning, and it is still under active development.

The platform is designed with HMU courses and laboratories in mind. The aim is to help students connect lecture material, lab experiments, and independent study so they can go beyond exam preparation, strengthen their problem‑solving skills, and build a deeper understanding of their course’s concepts that will support their future careers.

Originally, this project started as a personal learning platform inspired by the problem‑based, interactive style of Brilliant. Over time, its vision expanded through ideas from the EVE‑Impact and COIL initiatives of ATHENA European University, and especially from the course “AI Tools for Teaching,” which encouraged using AI to enrich teaching and learning experiences.

## Goals

Bright.HMU tries to:

- Help students understand difficult course’s concepts through short, focused lessons instead of long, dense notes.
- Align practice material with actual HMU courses and laboratories, so students can use it alongside their lectures, lab work, and assignments.
- Turn studying into active practice with quizzes, step‑by‑step problems, and instant feedback.
- Offer an integrated LLM assistant that provides hints, explanations, and follow‑up questions related to the course material and lab activities.
- Lower the barrier for asking questions by giving students a private, always‑available “study companion.”
- Support students in going a step further in their careers by developing deeper conceptual understanding and more confident independent learning habits.
- Experiment with modern teaching ideas (interactive content + AI) in the context of Hellenic Mediterranean University courses.

## Features (planned and in development)

- Modular lessons on core course’s concepts.
- Practice sets and examples inspired by typical HMU course content and lab exercises.
- Interactive quizzes with immediate feedback.
- Visual aids and formula rendering (LaTeX) to support technical content.
- Integrated LLM assistant for:
  - clarifying definitions and theory,
  - giving structured hints instead of full solutions,
  - suggesting extra practice questions,
  - helping students reflect on lab results and connect them to their course’s concepts.
- Simple, student‑friendly interface focused on learning, not distraction.

> Note: Bright.HMU is an early‑stage, experimental project. Features may change often as the design and educational approach evolve.

## Getting Started
Coming Soon....

## Inspiration

- **Brilliant** – for its interactive, problem‑driven way of teaching complex topics.
- **EVE‑Impact and COIL courses of ATHENA European University** – for promoting international collaboration and innovative educational practices.
- **“AI Tools for Teaching”** – for motivating the integration of AI tools into real teaching and learning workflows.

## Status

Bright.HMU is:
- A personal experimental project.
- Under active development.
- Open to future ideas on how to better align with actual HMU course content, laboratory work, and student needs
